# Day 7: Math for Machine Learning - Linear Algebra 🧮

## Topic: Vectors & Basic Operations
Today, I shifted my focus from coding to the **mathematical foundations** of Machine Learning. I watched **Siddhardhan's ML series** (Videos 5.1.0 - 5.1.2) to understand how data is represented mathematically.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned:

#### 1. What is a Vector?
- A quantity that has both **Magnitude** (Size) and **Direction**.
- **Scalar:** A single number (only magnitude).
- **Vector:** An ordered list of numbers (1D Array).
- **Geometric View:** A vector can be visualized as an arrow pointing from the origin (0,0) to a specific point (x,y).

#### 2. Vector Operations
- **Vector Addition:** Adding two vectors component-wise results in a new vector.
  - *Formula:* `[x1, y1] + [x2, y2] = [x1+x2, y1+y2]`
- **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a vector by a single number (scalar).
  - If scalar > 1: Vector **stretches**.
  - If scalar < 1: Vector **shrinks**.
  - If scalar is negative: Direction **flips**.

#### 3. Why is this important for ML?
- Machine Learning models do not understand images, text, or audio directly.
- All data must be converted into **Vectors** (numbers) for the machine to process.
- Operations like "finding similar movies" or "classifying images" rely entirely on vector math.
