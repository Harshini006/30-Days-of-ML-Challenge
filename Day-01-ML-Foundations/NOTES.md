# Day 1: Starting my ML Journey! 🚀

**Date:** Feb 03, 2026
**Topic:** ML Foundations

Today I kicked off my 30-day challenge. I started with the basics of Machine Learning using Python.

📝 My Learnings
* **The Core Concept:** Traditional programming is giving the computer rules. Machine Learning is giving the computer data so it can *figure out* the rules.
* **Workflow:** It always starts with Data. Collection -> Prep -> Train -> Test.
* **Supervised vs Unsupervised:**
    * *Supervised:* Like learning with a teacher (labeled data).
    * *Unsupervised:* Like figuring things out on your own (finding patterns).
💻 Setup
Just did a quick check to make sure my libraries are working:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
print("Ready to start coding!")
